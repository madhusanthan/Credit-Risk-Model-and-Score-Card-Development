# Credit-Risk-Model-and-Score-Card-Development
Develop Risk Model and Score card for Lending Loan Dataset


### Data Preprocessing, EDA and Feature Importance.ipynb 
Data Pre-processing, Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis of the Cleaned Dataset. Also, Feature Importance is evaluated for categorical features using Chi-squared statistic and numerical features using ANOVA F-statisitic

### Credit Risk Modeling.ipynb
Model evaluation using different strategies:
  1. Train-test Split and model evaluation using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier
  2. Stratified K-fold cross validation and model evaluation using Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Tree Classifier
 
Test the performance of the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Roc_auc

### Credit Scorecard Development.ipynb
- Scorecard Modeling using OptBinning and scorecard development and visualizing the performance of scorecard
- Pickling and unpickling process for prediction of test data scores in production
